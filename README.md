# Word-Cloud-Generator
Generates a word cloud from a locally stored text file.

Uses the tkinter Python library for the file selection GUI

The most frequent words in the text file appear the largest while the least frequent words in the text file appear the smallest in the generated word cloud image.

Uninteresting words such as 'for', 'the', 'a', and many others have been omitted from the word cloud.

The following lines may need to be run on the terminal in order for this program to work properly:

pip install matplotlib

pip install wordcloud
