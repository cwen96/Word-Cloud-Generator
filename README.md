# Word-Cloud-Generator
Generates a word cloud from a locally stored text file.

The most frequent words in the text file appear the largest while the least frequent words in the text file appear the smallest in the generated wordcloud image.

Uninteresting words such as 'for', 'the', 'a', and many others have been omitted from the word cloud.

The following lines may need to be run on the command terminal in order for this program to work properly:

pip install matplotlib
pip install wordcloud
